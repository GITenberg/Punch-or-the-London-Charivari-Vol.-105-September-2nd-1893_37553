<h2 class="sans">LETTERS TO ABSTRACTIONS.</h2>

<h3>TO FAILURE</h3>

<p><i>Ecce iterum!</i> Well, why not? So long as I do not exanimate
you with my letters, I remain content. Besides, I have not yet fully-developed
all my theories. Let us, therefore, continue to chat
together for a little.</p>

<p>I cannot proceed for ever by the negative method. No doubt I
might in the end, exhaust the list of those who are not your subjects,
but the process would be long, and, I fear, tedious. No; I must
come to the point and produce my cases. What shall we say of
them, then? <span class="sc">Hood</span> declares that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"There is a silence where hath been no sound,</p>
<p>There is a silence where no sound may be,</p>
<p>In the cold grave, under the deep, deep sea."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and so forth; doubtless you remember the sonnet. Not there, however,
is the true silence&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"But in green ruins, in the desolate walls</p>
<p>Of antique palaces, where Man hath been,</p>
<p>Though the dun fox, or wild hyena calls,</p>
<p>And owls, that flit continually between,</p>
<p>Shriek to the echo, and the low winds moan,&mdash;</p>
<p>There the true Silence is, self-conscious and alone."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>As with silence, so with failure, say I. The
man who has never felt the spur of ambition nor
the intoxication of a success, who has travelled
always upon the level tracts of an unaspiring
satisfaction, on him, surely, failure sets no mark,
and disappointment has for him no stings. But
the poor souls who soar only to sink, who melt
their waxen wings in the fierce heat of the sun,
and fall crashing to earth, theirs is the lot for
pity. And yet it is not well to be too sure. For
in the eyes of the world a man may be cheated
of his purpose, and yet gain for himself the
peace, the sober, contented joy, which is more
to him than the flaunting trophies of open success.
And some clasp the goddess in their arms,
only to wither and decay in the embrace they
sought with so eager a passion. But I tarry,
while time creeps on.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/097-400.png"><img src="images/097-200.png" width="200" height="470" alt="From the mist of memory...." /></a></div>

<p>From the mist of memory rises a scene. A
knot of laughing Freshmen is gathered in the
ancient Court outside the lecture-room staircase.
It wants a minute or two to the hour.
They are jesting and chaffing with all the
delightful unconcern of emancipated youth,
and their cheerful faces shine brighter in the
October sunshine. Some thirty yards away
from them a strange figure, in dingy cap and
gown, paces wearily along. It is that of a
prematurely aged man, his back bent, his head
sunk upon his chest. The Freshmen begin to
knock one another about; there is what we
used to call a "rag," and one of them, seizing
a small lump of turf, throws it at a companion.
It misses him, and strikes the old, weary figure
on the back of the neck. He totters forward
with outstretched hands, just saves himself from falling, and turns
round. There is a terrible, hunted, despairing look on the face,
made more pitiful by the grey, straggling beard. The Freshman
has darted forward with an apology. The old man mutters, half
to himself, "What was it? Did some one call for me? I am
quite alone, and I scarcely remember&mdash;&mdash;" and then shuffles away
quickly, without listening to the words of apology. The adventure
chills the laughter of the young men, the clock strikes, and they
vanish to the lecture-room.</p>

<p>This poor, rambling, distraught wreck of a man, was all that
was left in those days of a great and brilliant scholar, whose fame a
quarter of a century before had been alive in the mouths of Cambridge
men. From the moment that he entered at St. Mark's,
<span class="sc">Henry Arkwright</span> began a glorious career of prize-winning.
Scholarships were to him a part of his daily bread. He swallowed
them as other men swallow rolls for breakfast. A magic influence
seemed to smooth for him the rough and rocky paths of learning.
While his comrades stumbled along with bruised limbs, he marched
with firm and triumphant step to the summit. And he had other
advantages. He was handsome, his manner was frank and winning,
he was an athlete of distinction, he spoke with fiery and epigrammatic
eloquence at the Union. It is needless to add that his popularity
was unbounded amongst his companions. He took the best
degree of his year, and was made a Fellow of his College.</p>

<p>There was no lack of glowing prophecies about his future. The
only doubt was whether the Lord Chancellorship or the post of Prime
Minister would more attract his genius. Nobody supposed that he
would stay on at Cambridge. But he did. A few years after taking
his degree he published a monumental edition of a Greek classic,
which is still one of the fountain-heads of authority, even amongst
the severe scholars of the Fatherland. And after that there was an
end of him. Nobody quite knew what had happened to him, and as
the years rolled on fewer and fewer cared to inquire. He went to
hall, he sat silent in the Combination-room, he withdrew himself
gradually from all intercourse with friends. His whole appearance
changed, he became dishevelled, his face grew old and wrinkled, and
his hair turned grey before his time. And thus dwindling and shrinking
he had come to be the pitiable shadow who, as I have related,
faded dismally across the College Court before a knot of cheerful
Undergraduates on an October morning many years ago. What was
the reason? I have often wondered. Did his labours over his book
displace by a hair's-breadth some minute particle of matter in his
brain? Or was there in his nature a lack of the genuine manly
fibre, unsuspected even by himself until he felt himself fatally
recoiling from the larger life of which the
triumphs seemed to be within his grasp, if only
he would stretch out his hand and seize them?
I know not. Somebody once hinted that there
was a woman at the bottom of it. There may
have been, but it is a canon of criticism to
reject the easier solution. When he died a few
years ago, it appeared to be a shock to all but
a few to remember that he had not died ages
before.</p>

<p>And as I write this, I am reminded, I scarce
know why, of poor Mrs. <span class="sc">Highflyer</span>. <i>Poor</i>
Mrs. <span class="sc">Highflyer</span>! I hear somebody exclaim in
astonishment. Why is she poor? Why must
we pity her? Is she not rich? Do not the
great and the titled throng to her parties during
the London Season? Has she not entertained
Princes in the country? What lot can be more
enviable? Granted, I reply, as to the riches
and the parties. But can it be seriously supposed
that a life spent in a feverish struggle for
recognition, its days and nights devoted to
schemes for social advancement, to little plots
by which Lady <span class="sc">Mottling</span>, the wife of the millionaire
Member of Parliament, shall be out-witted;
or Mrs. <span class="sc">Furber</span>, the wife of the returned
Australian, shall be made to pale her ineffectual
fires; to conspiracies which shall end in a
higher rung of the giddy ladder of party-giving
ambition&mdash;can such a life, I ask, with all its
petty miseries, its desperations, its snubs, and
its successes no less perilous than desperation,
be considered an enviable one? Ask Mrs. <span class="sc">Highflyer</span>
herself. Visit that poor lady, as she is
laying her parallels for her tenth attempt to
capture some stout and red-faced royalty for
her dance or her country-house, and see for
yourself how she feels. She may bear aloft a
smiling face, but there is unhappiness in her
heart, and all her glories are as nothing to her,
because she has read in the <i>Weekly Treadmill</i>
that Lady <span class="sc">Mottling's</span> latest party was attended
by a Royal Duke, two Ambassadors, and a Kamtchatkan Chieftain.
There is failure in the meanest shape. Was I right to pity her?</p>

<p>Are there not, moreover, critics and literary celebrities who&mdash;&mdash;but
I dare too much, my pen refuses its office, so tremendous is the
subject on which I have rashly entered. And with that, farewell.</p>

<h3>EFFEMINACY OF THE AGE.</h3>

<p class="ind2">Mr. <span class="sc">James Payn</span> says that "some boys are really missed at home."
Well, <i>Mr. Punch</i> has observed that some fond and foolish parents
tog and tittivate their boys till they look behind like girls. But to
"<i>miss</i>" them, as though they were maidens or barmaids is <i>too</i>
bad. To adapt <span class="sc">Ko-Ko's</span> celebrated song, he would say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>A boy may wear his hair in curls, or bear a pudding face,</p>
<p class="i2">Some mothers, as you wist, that folly can't resist!</p>
<p>Of true boy in dress and manners they may leave him scarce a trace,</p>
<p class="i2">But he never should be "missed"&mdash;he never should be "missed."</p>
<p>Maternal idiots molly-coddle little lads they own,</p>
<p>Till they're girlish in demeanour, and effeminate in tone,</p>
<p>But the <i>mater</i> who her "<span class="sc">Tommy</span>" spoils, and dresses like a guy,</p>
<p>Till he doesn't think he crickets, and has no desire to try;</p>
<p>Is a silly, weak anomaly who ought to be well hissed;</p>
<p>Boys never should be "missy," and they never should be "missed."</p>

<h2>CURE-IOUS!</h2>

<p>Saw advertisement to-day, "Wanted, a
few hopeless Drunkards," from a person
who has a new Patent Remedy for Dipsomania.
Fancy that I answer the description.
Why should I not apply? Funds
rather low just at present, and I might get
the price of a few bottles of gin out of this
Anti-Alcoholic Enthusiast. He asks us to
"apply by letter." Better to see if it's all
a hoax or not. Shall go in person.</p>

<p>Have just made my application. Four
other inebriates had also gone in person.
They were in the waiting-room when I
arrived, in advanced stage of <i>delirium
tremens</i>. Scandalous! All of them
had fiery serpents coming out of their
boots, too, which they set at me directly
I appeared. What the police are
about in allowing such people at large
I cannot understand. Obliged to defend
myself against the serpents. I believe
a shindy ensued, and I was accused&mdash;most
unjustly&mdash;of being intoxicated,
whereas I had purposely abstained
from taking more than half a bottle
of neat Cognac that morning, in order
to have my head quite clear for the
interview. However, had a chat with
the Enthusiast, who said he thought
I would "do very well." Wants me
to get a couple of "good testimonials"
from my friends, saying that I have
"really made a hopeless beast of
myself for at least two years past."
Rather awkward this, as most of my
old chums refuse to see me now. Such
is friendship!</p>

<p>Testimonials secured at last. Had
to create a slight disturbance outside
the houses of my friends before I could
get them to do what I wanted. When
they <i>did</i> really understand what was
expected, they gave me the highest
character for inebriety. One says that
he "has good reason for knowing that
I have not been really sober for more
than a day at a time for the last five
years." The other "willingly certifies"
that "a more absolutely besotted
specimen of gin-soddened humanity"
it would be impossible to find. Sent
the replies off to the Enthusiast, who
returns me some of the Patent Remedy
in a bottle, "to be taken as
directed," but no money! What a
swindle! Pawnbroker round the corner
declines to advance a farthing on the
Remedy. Nothing left but to try it!</p>

<p>Have tried it! Awfully good stuff!
Must have gin in it, I think. Leave
off my nightly potation of spirits, and
drink half the bottle instead. Refreshing
sleep. Haven't had such a
night for ages. Enthusiast calls to
see how I am getting on. Immensely
pleased. Leaves me another bottle of
the Remedy, and&mdash;on my threatening
to strike unless he gives me some
money&mdash;half a sovereign. Get in more
gin.</p>

<p>Extraordinary thing has happened.
Gin seems positively nasty to me now!
Forced myself to drink a little. Deadly
sick! There must be something very
unwholesome about the Remedy. Pitch
rest of it out of window.</p>

<p>Glad to say that my taste for gin
has come back. Was able to finish
half a bottle at a sitting. Go round
to Enthusiast's office, to tell him
about dangerous effect of his alleged
Remedy. He says "the sickness and
the distaste for gin was just what he
wanted to produce." The inhuman
monster! Give him a little of my mind,
and he retreats into an inner room, and his
Clerk comes out to try and remove me from
the premises. Curiously enough, the Clerk's
front teeth all suddenly drop out and turn
into green and red dragons, which writhe
about the floor. Some sort of disturbance
happens&mdash;believe Clerk tries to kill me&mdash;forget
all the rest.</p>

<p><i>Later.</i>&mdash;Appear to be in a Police cell!
Why don't they shut up the keyhole to
prevent those gamboge-coloured elephants
getting through? Why has the Warder
fifteen heads? Shall complain to the Home
Secretary. Also shall make it hot for that
Enthusiast when I get out.</p>

<p>I think I have mentioned that the vast intellect of my friend
<span class="sc">Holes</span> took as great a delight in unravelling the petty complexities of
some slight secret as in tracing back to its source the turbid torrent
of a crime that had set all Europe ablaze. Nothing, in fact, was
too small for this great man; he lived only to unravel; his days and
nights were spent in deciphering criminal cryptograms. Many and
many a time have I said to him, "<span class="sc">Holes</span>, you ought to marry, and
train up an offspring of detective marvels. It is a sin to allow such
a genius as yours to remain unreproduced." But he only smiled at
me in his calm, impassive, unmuscular, and unemotional manner,
and put me off with some such phrase as, "I am wedded to my
art," or, "Detection is my wife; she loves, honours, and <i>obeys</i>
me&mdash;qualities
I could never find in a mate of flesh and blood." I merely
mention these trifles in order to give my readers some further insight
into the character of a remarkable man with whom it was my
privilege to be associated on more than one occasion during those
investigations of which the mere account has astonished innumerable
Continents.</p>

<p>During the early Summer of the
year before last a matter of scientific
research took me to Cambridge. It
will be remembered that at that time
an obscure disease had appeared in
London, and had claimed many
victims. Careful study had convinced
me that this illness, the
symptoms of which were sudden
fear, followed by an inclination to
run away, and ending in complete
prostration, were due to the presence
in the blood of what is now known
as the Proctor Bacillus, so called on
account of two white patches on its
chest, which had all the appearance
of the bands worn by the Proctor
during the discharge of his unpleasant
constabulary functions in
the streets and purlieus of University
towns. In order to carry on my
investigations at the very fountainhead,
as it were, I had accepted a
long-standing invitation from my
old friend Colonel the Reverend
<span class="sc">Henry Bagnet</span>, who not only commanded
the Cambridge University
Volunteers, but was, in addition, one
of the most distinguished scholarly
ornaments of the great College of
St. Baldred's.</p>

<p>On the evening to which my story
relates we had dined together in the
gorgeous mess-room which custom
and the liberality of the University
authorities have consecrated to the
use of the gallant corps whose motto
of "<i>Quis jaculatur scarabæum?</i>" has been borne triumphantly
in the van of many a review on the Downs of Brighton and
elsewhere. The countless delicacies appropriate to the season,
the brilliant array of grey uniforms, the heavy gold plate which
loaded the oak side-board, the choice vintages of France and
Germany, all these had combined with the clank of swords, the
jingle of spurs, the emphatic military words of command uttered by
light-hearted undergraduates, and the delightful semi-military,
semi-clerical anecdotes of that old war-dog, Colonel <span class="sc">Bagnet</span>, to
make up a memorable evening in the experience of a careworn
medical practitioner who had left the best part of his health and his
regulation overalls on the bloody battle-field of Tantia-Tee, in the
Afghan jungle.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="sc">Bagnet</span> had just ordered the head mess-waiter to produce
six more bottles of the famous "die-hard" port, laid down by his
predecessor in the command during the great town and gown riots of
1870. In these terrible civic disturbances the University Volunteers,
as most men of middle age will remember, specially distinguished
themselves by the capture and immediate execution of the
truculent Mayor of Cambridge, who was the prime mover in the
commotion. The wine was circulating freely, and conversation was
flowing with all the <i>verve</i> and <i>abandon</i> that mark the intercourse
of undergraduates with dons. Just as I was congratulating the
Colonel on the excellence of his port the door opened, and a man of
forbidding aspect, clothed in the heavy garments of a mathematical
moderator, entered the mess-room.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Colonel," said the new arrival, bringing his
hand to his college cap with an awkward imitation of the military
salute. "I am sorry to disturb the harmony of the evening, but I
have the Vice-Chancellor's orders to inform you that the largest and
fiercest of our pack of bull-dogs has escaped from his kennel. I am
to request you to send a detachment after him immediately. He
was last heard barking on the Newmarket Road."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/100-900.png"><img src="images/100-350.png" width="350" height="425" alt="'How now, Sirrah?' he replied; 'how dare you insinuate that----" /></a>
<p class="center">"How now, Sirrah?" he replied; "how dare you insinuate
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p></div>

<p>In a moment all was confusion. Colonel <span class="sc">Bagnet</span> brandished an
empty champagne bottle, and in a voice broken with emotion
ordered the regiment to form in half-sections, an intricate
man&oelig;uvre, which was fortunately carried out without bloodshed.
What might have happened next I know not. Everybody was
dangerously excited, and it needed but a spark to kindle an
explosion. Suddenly I heard a well-known voice behind me.</p>

<p>"One moment, Colonel," said <span class="sc">Picklock Holes</span>, for it was none
other, though how he had obtained an entrance I have never discovered;
"you desire to find your lost canine assistant? I can
help you, but first tell me why a soldier of your age and experience
should insist on wearing a lamb's-wool undervest."</p>

<p>The guests were speechless. Colonel <span class="sc">Bagnet</span> was blue with
suppressed rage.</p>

<p>"How now, Sirrah?" he replied; "how dare you insinuate
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tush, Colonel <span class="sc">Bagnet</span>," said my
wonderful friend, pointing to the
furious warrior's mess-waistcoat;
"it is impossible to deceive me. That
stain of mint-sauce extending across
your chest can be explained only on
the hypothesis that you wear underclothing
manufactured from lamb.
That," he continued, smiling coldly
at me, "must be obvious to the
meanest capacity." For once in his
life the Colonel had no retort handy.</p>

<p>"I am at your orders," he said,
shortly. "The man who can prove
that I wear lamb's-wool when I am
actually wearing silk is the man for
my money." In another moment
<span class="sc">Holes</span> had organised the pursuit.</p>

<p>"It would be as well," he remarked,
"to have an accurate description
of the animal we are in
search of. He was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the impatient Colonel interrupted.
"A brindled bull, very
deep in the chest, with two kinks in
his tail; has lost one of his front
teeth, and snores violently."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>; "the
description tallies."</p>

<p>"But, <span class="sc">Holes</span>," I ventured to say,
"this is most extraordinary. You,
who have never been in Cambridge
before, know all the details of the
dog. It is wonderful."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Holes</span> waved me off with as near
an approach to impatience as I have
ever seen him exhibit. Having
done this, he once more addressed the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Your best plan," he said, "will be to scour the King's Parade.
You will not find him there. Next you must visit the Esquire
<span class="sc">Bedell</span>, and thoroughly search his palace from basement to attic.
The dog will not be there, but the search will give you several
valuable clues. You will then proceed to the University Library,
and in the fifth gallery, devoted to Chinese manuscripts, you will
find&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>As <span class="sc">Holes</span> uttered these words the mathematical moderator again
entered. "Sir," he said to the Colonel, "it was all a mistake. The
dog is quite safe. He has never been out of his kennel."</p>

<p>"That," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>, "is exactly what I was coming to. In the
fifth gallery, devoted to Chinese manuscripts, you will find no
readers. Hurrying on thence, and guiding your steps by the all-pervasive
odour of meat-fibrine biscuits, you will eventually arrive
at the kennel, and find the dog."</p>

<p>"Zounds! Mr. <span class="sc">Holes</span>," said the admiring Colonel, in the midst
of the laugh that followed on <span class="sc">Holes's</span> last words, "you are an
astounding fellow." And that is why, at the last Cambridge Commencement,
the degree of LL.D. honoris causâ was conferred on
<span class="sc">Picklock Holes</span>, together with a Fellowship at St. Baldred's,
worth £800 a year. But my friend is modesty itself. "It is not,"
he said, "the honorary degree that I value half so much as the
consciousness that I did my duty, and helped a Colonel in the hour
of his need." And with these simple words Dr. <span class="sc">Picklock Holes</span>
dismissed one of his finest achievements.</p>

<p>Some, like myself, are still found in "Hall,"</p>

<h2>MEETING OF THE ANTI-BIOGRAPHERS.</h2>

<h3>(<i>From Notes supplied by Superhuman Reporters.</i>)</h3>

<p>A meeting was recently held in the early dawn to consider
"Biographies in General, and the lives of British Celebrities in
Particular." The site chosen for the gathering was so indefinite,
that it is impossible to give it accurate geographical expression.
There was a large number of shades present, and Dr. <span class="sc">Samuel
Johnson</span> was unanimously voted to the chair.</p>

<p>The President, in thanking those who had done him the favour
of thus honouring him, observed that, although he appreciated the
compliment that had been bestowed upon him, he could not express
any particular esteem for the intelligence of those who had been
the cause of his occupying his present position. (<i>Laughter.</i>) He
did not understand the reason which had prompted merriment as
a fitting recognition of his remarks. If they were satisfied, he was
content. He had been called to take the chair, he supposed, because
he had nothing to do with his own biography. That had been
written by a Scottish gentleman, with whom he had no sympathy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Boswell</span>: I hope, Sir, you do not mean what you say.</p>

<p>The President (with great severity): Yes, Sir, I do. I think
that the man who would write the life of another without his
sanction is unworthy&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Cries of "Agreed."</i>) The learned
Doctor continued. He did not wish to force his sentiments upon
any one. No doubt his opinions were considered behind the time.
Everything had changed nowadays, and even his Dictionary was,
more or less, superseded by an American Lexicon. He called upon
the Emperor <span class="sc">Napoleon Buonaparte</span> to move the first resolution.</p>

<p>The Emperor <span class="sc">Napoleon Buonaparte</span> expressed his satisfaction that
he should have been allowed to take the lead in this matter. It reminded
him of old times, when he took the lead in everything.
("<i>Hear, hear.</i>") He represented, he supposed, "Biographies in
General,"&mdash;as he had not much sympathy with British worthies. He
wished bygones to be bygones (<i>"Hear, hear"</i>), but he must say that
the conduct of Sir <span class="sc">Hudson Lowe</span> was&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Interruption.</i>) Well, he
did not wish to press the matter further. ("<i>Hear, hear.</i>") There
was no doubt that unless a man wrote his autobiography he was always
misrepresented. (<i>Cheers.</i>) It was high time that some control should
be put upon the publication of the lives of those who had joined the
majority. He had much pleasure in proposing the following resolution:
"It is the opinion of this meeting of Shades assembled in
council in Elysium that steps should be taken to prevent the dissemination
of false information about their prior existences."</p>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Walter Scott</span> said that it gave him great pleasure to second
a resolution moved with such admirable discretion by his imperial
and heroic friend the last speaker. He had the greater satisfaction
in doing this as it might lead to a new and amended edition of his
own "<i>Life of Napoleon</i>."</p>

<p>A Shade, who refused to give either his name or address, begged
to oppose the motion. In his opinion modern biographies were a
great deal better than work of the same kind of an earlier date.
("<i>No, no.</i>") But he said "Yes, yes." It was now quite the
fashion to whitewash everyone. He would testify that he recently
read a biography of himself without recognising the subject. Since
then his self esteem had increased a hundred fold. (<i>Laughter.</i>) He
thought it would be a great mistake to interfere. They had much
better leave things as they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">William Shakspeare</span> (who was received with applause)
asked permission to offer a practical suggestion. Although he was a
poet, he was also a man of business. (<i>Laughter.</i>) He spoke
smarting under a personal grievance. It was common knowledge
that only a short while ago the bulk of his works was declared to
have been written by Bacon. (Cries of "<i>Shame.</i>") However, it
was no use to pass resolutions unless they could carry them into
effect. He would therefore move an amendment to the resolution
already before them, to the following effect: "That to carry out
any arrangement that may be considered necessary, those present
pledge themselves to subscribe a crown a piece." He proposed
this under the impression that, granted the requisite funds, it would
be possible to communicate with the mundane authorities.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Isaac Newton</span> had much pleasure in seconding the amendment.
He might add, that it was quite within the resources of
science to do all that was required. He would explain in detail
how it could be done.</p>

<p>The learned gentleman then began a lecture, with the effect that
the meeting rapidly dissolved. After he had been speaking for an
hour and a quarter, he discovered that he had no auditors.</p>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM</h4>

<h3>THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, August 21.</i>&mdash;Some
excellent speaking to-night. <span class="sc">Squire
Of Malwood</span> in fine form. Opportunity made
to his hand. With <span class="sc">Joseph</span>, friend and ally of
Conservative Ministry that had invented and
applied Guillotine Closure, indignantly protesting
against the "gag," there was room
for obvious remark. Then there was J. C.'s
article in monthly magazine of so recent date
as 1890, in which, in his forcible manner, he
had, with circumstance, demanded application
of gag not only to successive stages in
important measures, but to Supply.</p>

<p>"Oh that mine enemy would write an
article in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>!" exclaimed
<span class="sc">George Curzon</span>. "Anyone could make a
speech with such opportunity as the <span class="sc">Squire</span>
has."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the Member for <span class="sc">Sark</span>;
"but perhaps they mightn't do it so
well."</p>

<p>Another good speech from unexpected
quarter was <span class="sc">Whitbread's</span>. <span class="sc">Whitbread</span> is
the Serious Person of the Liberal Party.
Whenever Mr. G. gets into difficulties on
constitutional questions or points of Parliamentary
practice, <span class="sc">Whitbread</span> solemnly
marches to front, and says nothing particular
with imposing air that carries conviction.
To-day came out quite in new style; almost
epigrammatic, certainly pointed. Quite a
model of Parliamentary speech of the old
stately, yet flexible style now little known.</p>

<p class="center">Prince Arthur the Jester</p></div>

<p>Best of all, <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>. Never heard him to greater advantage.
As a former Leader once said, the House of Commons, above
all things, likes to be shown sport. <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> showed the
way to-night, crowded House merrily following. It was ticklish
ground, for he was chaffing Mr. G. Not a good subject upon which
to expend wit or satire. The <span class="sc">Prince</span> did it so daintily, with such
light, graceful touch, such
shining absence of acerbity,
such brimming over with
contagious good humour,
that the cloud vanished
from the brow of Jove.
Beginning to listen with a
frown, Mr. G. presently
beamed into a laugh. As
for his colleagues on either
hand, their merriment was
as unrestrained as it was on
remoter benches. Only
<span class="sc">Mundella</span> managed to keep
a Ministerial countenance.
The play was good, but the
theme too sacred to be
lightly handled. To him,
seated on the left, Mr. G.
gratefully turned in earlier
stages of the speech and
whispered his scathing comment.
<span class="sc">Mundella</span> behaved
nobly. The <span class="sc">Solicitor-General</span>,
who had his share
in the genial roasting, might
roar with Homeric laughter.
<span class="sc">Mundella</span> gravely shook
his head in response to Mr.
G.'s whispered remarks.
Fancy, however, he was
grateful when Mr. G. began
to laugh and the President
of the Board of Trade was
free to smile. Speech as useful as it was delightful. Showed to
whom it may concern that venerable age may be criticised without
discourtesy, and high position attacked without insolence.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Settled that Report Stage of Home-Rule Bill shall
close on Friday.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;"Mr. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, Sir. One or two ideas occur to
me." It was the voice of <span class="sc">MacGregor</span> uplifted from back bench,
where a retiring disposition (he retired from medical practice some
years ago) leads him to take his seat. Moment critical; debate long
proceeding on Amendment moved by <span class="sc">Napoleon Boltonparty</span>,
which had called down on Imperial head a fearsome whack from
hand of Mr. G.; House growing impatient for Division; <span class="sc">Speaker</span>
risen to put question, when <span class="sc">The MacGregor</span> interposed. Evidently
in for long clinical lecture. Hand partly extended, palm downwards;
eyes half closed; head thrown back, and the voice
impressively intoned.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, Sir, a few ideas have occurred to me."</p>

<p><span class="sc">The MacGregor</span> got no further; a shout of hilarious laughter
broke in upon his reverie. Opened his eyes, and looked hastily
round. He, <span class="sc">Donald MacGregor</span>, First Prizeman in Chemistry
and Surgery; Second Prizeman in Physiology and Midwifery;
Licentiate of both the Royal Colleges of Physicians and of Surgeons,
Edinburgh; practised at Penrith, Cumberland, and in London;
formerly Medical Officer and Public Vaccinator for Penrith and
district; Resident Physician at the Peebles Hydropathic Institute;
Medical Superintendent of the Barnhill Hospital and Asylum,
Glasgow&mdash;yes, all this, and House of Commons was laughing
at him!</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what," he gasped, making motion as if he would feel
the <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> pulse. "I don't understand. I very rarely speak;
have said nothing before on this Bill. Now, when something
occurs to me hon. members laugh."</p>

<p>House touched by this appeal; generously cheered. Doctor,
resuming his oratorical attitude, proceeded.</p>

<p>"I think," he remarked, with hand again outstretched, eyes half
closed, and head thrown back as before, "it was <span class="sc">Sydney Smith</span>
who said, When doctors differ who shall decide."</p>

<p>The Doctor was awakened out of his oratorical trance by another
shout of laughter. What on earth was the matter now? Perhaps
if he kept his eyes open he would see better where the joke came in.
Took the precaution, but had not proceeded more than two minutes
before <span class="sc">Speaker</span> down on him; after which he thought it best to
resume his seat.</p>

<p>"I give it up, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," he said; "as <span class="sc">Asquith</span> yesterday gave up
that conundrum I put to him as to why, if repeated breaches of
the vaccination law justify the remission of penalties, the same
practice should not apply in case of breaches of the land laws. The
House of Commons for pleasure, I suppose; but for "ordinary" sanity
give me Peebles and its Hydropathic Institute."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Report Stage of Home-Rule Bill.</p>

<p class="center">"All's well that ends well."</p></div>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;"Been up to see Fulham," said Member for <span class="sc">Sark</span>,
hurrying in just in time to miss Division. "The place fascinates
me. No lions there, and no necessity for getting up a lamp-post; so
would not interest <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>. But <span class="sc">Hayes Fisher</span> is Member for
Fulham, and he, you know, is the man who discovered, after (as he
said) he had taken <span class="sc">Logan</span> by the scruff of the neck and 'so begun
the scrimmage,' that Mr. G. was more criminally responsible for
what followed 'even than <span class="sc">Logan</span>.' That is delightful. Fulham not
to be outdone by its Member. Last night indignation meeting
held in Town Hall to protest against conduct of <span class="sc">Hayes Fisher</span>
and 'proceedings in House of Commons on Thursday, July 27.' Hall
crowded; indignation seething; gentlemen of Fulham could hardly
contain themselves in contemplation of iniquity of a man who,
differing from another on matter of opinion, took him by the coat-collar
and shook him. Meeting summoned at instance of Fulham
Liberal and Radical Association. Seemed at first that all in room
were good Radicals. As evening advanced, presence of one or two
gentlemen of another way of thinking manifested. One called out.
'Three cheers for Fisher!' and what, my <span class="sc">Toby</span>, did these men of
Fulham do&mdash;these gentlemen met in solemn conclave with avowed
object of denouncing physical outrage and clearing fair name of
Fulham from slur brought upon it by athletic proceedings of <span class="sc">Hayes
Fisher</span>? Why, they up and at the Fisherites, with the result,
as I read in the papers, 'that a struggle ensued, one man being
seized and violently hustled from the Hall.' After this the meeting
settled down, and unanimously passed a resolution expressing its
condemnation of 'the disorderly and disgraceful scene in the House
of Commons on Thursday, July 27.' Don't know how it strikes
you. But to me that is most delightful incident in the day's news.
Felt constrained to make pilgrimage to Fulham, to see a place where
Member and Constituency are so rarely matched. Don't suppose
I've missed much here?"</p>

<p>No, nothing; just filling up time; waiting for to-morrow night,
and Closure to come.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;None.</p>

<p><i>Friday midnight.</i>&mdash;Report Stage Home-Rule Bill just agreed to;
a dull evening till the last quarter of an hour, when <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span>
took the floor and thoroughly enjoyed himself. Everyone concerned,
more especially those concerned in prolonging debate, glad it's over.
<span class="sc">Donald Crawford</span> so excited at prospect of approaching holidays
that on first Division he got into wrong Lobby; voted against one of
<span class="sc">John Morley's</span> new Clauses, reducing Ministerial majority to 36.
On two subsequent Divisions was carefully watched into right
Lobby, and majority maintained at 38.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
